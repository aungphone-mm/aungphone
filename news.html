The Amazing Gold Market! Maintaining Your Jewelry Focus on Pearls Akoya Glossary of Pearl Terminology Recent Diamond Acquisitions 2 2 3 3 4 It is my pleasure to welcome you to the first publication of our newsletter. This effort is an exciting step for our company and comes packaged with other changes that will result in our staff being able to better serve you. Many of you have commented about the "new faces" you have seen at the store on recent occasions. After a thorough search process within the industry, Richard Aguila, Kim Radford, and Robbie Betancourt, joined our staff almost two years ago. Jennifer Adams, who manages our pearl inventory has been with us for close to three years. Nichole Freeman has been with us for nine years and Kelly McQuarrie, who is now employed fulltime, has worked at the store for almost twelve years. Mike Leach has been an integral part of our staff either full-time or part-time for close to 15 years and now his son, Anthony, also works part-time. The true constant of the store is our master bench jeweler, Gary Slates, who has called Bashinski Fine Gems and Jewelry, Inc. home for over 23 years. And yes, I still work over 60 hours a week at the store, though more often than not I am in the back manufacturing, or traveling overseas in search of our diamond inventory.<br>

<font size=5>Company News</font><br>

By Stephen Bashinski No matter what changes you see at the store in the coming months and years, rest assured that we maintain our unwavering commitment to provide quality service at a competitive price. We are proud to say that we custom manufacture most of our jewelry, and we will continue to service you, our customers, in a comfortable and friendly environment. Let us know what you think of the newsletter. We listen to your feedback carefully and value your thoughts and comments. Sincerely, Stephen

Laser Welding at a Glance
Technology plays a major part in all of our lives. Here at

By Robbie Betancourt of the welding process. Instead of soldering a joint together, which is essentially melting a "filler" metal between two pieces, laser welding utilizes fusion. The energy from the laser fuses two pieces together creating a molecular bond 250 times stronger than solder. Also, laser welding uses the original alloy to fill the void between the two pieces being welded, which prevents any unwanted discoloration in the seam. Lastly, the heat from the laser is minimal and isolated which allows us to weld on pieces with heat sensitive stones.

sparkle, we have long been embracing future technology by way of laser welding. Our laser welder provides a stronger, more accurate, and uncontaminated weld over traditional methods. The benefits are due to the nature.
